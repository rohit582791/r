## Understanding the Core Differences

Before diving into which strategy is "best," it's crucial to understand what each entails. **Digital marketing** is a broad term encompassing all marketing efforts that use an electronic device or the internet. **Affiliate marketing**, on the other hand, is a specific digital marketing tactic where you earn a commission by promoting other people's or company's products.

Here's a breakdown of key differences:

*   **Scope:** Digital marketing is a comprehensive strategy; affiliate marketing is a specific tactic within that strategy.
*   **Responsibility:** In digital marketing, you're often responsible for the entire marketing process, from strategy to execution. In affiliate marketing, your primary responsibility is promotion.
*   **Risk:** Digital marketing involves more upfront investment and risk. Affiliate marketing is generally lower risk since you don't need to create or own the product.
*   **Control:** Digital marketers have more control over branding and customer experience. Affiliates have limited control, as they're promoting someone else's product.
*   **Revenue Model:** Digital marketing revenue can come from various sources (direct sales, lead generation, etc.). Affiliate marketing revenue comes solely from commissions on sales.
