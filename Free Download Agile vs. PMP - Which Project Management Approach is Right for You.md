## Understanding Agile and PMP: A Quick Overview

Before diving into the course itself, let's briefly outline what Agile and PMP represent.

*   **Agile:** Agile is an iterative and flexible approach to project management. It's characterized by short development cycles (sprints), continuous feedback, and a focus on delivering value quickly. Popular Agile frameworks include Scrum, Kanban, and Lean. Agile excels in projects with evolving requirements and where collaboration is paramount.

*   **PMP (Project Management Professional):** PMP, on the other hand, is a certification offered by the Project Management Institute (PMI). It reflects a deep understanding of project management principles and practices, as outlined in the PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge) Guide. While the PMBOK Guide is methodology-agnostic, PMP often implies a more traditional, plan-driven approach. The focus is on comprehensive planning, detailed documentation, and rigorous control throughout the project lifecycle.
