## Understanding the Alfabeto Pitagorico: A Beginner's Guide

The Alfabeto Pitagorico isn’t just a simple letter-to-number conversion. It's a nuanced system based on the principles of numerology and the teachings of Pythagoras. Each letter of the alphabet is assigned a numerical value from 1 to 9, following a specific pattern. This allows for the calculation of numerological values for names, words, and phrases, which are then interpreted to reveal hidden meanings and insights.

**Why study the Alfabeto Pitagorico?**

*   **Unlock Hidden Meanings:** Discover the numerical significance behind names and words, revealing deeper layers of understanding.
*   **Personal Insights:** Analyze your own name to gain insights into your personality traits, strengths, and weaknesses.
*   **Relationship Analysis:** Explore the numerological compatibility between individuals by comparing their name values.
*   **Historical Context:** Understand the historical and philosophical roots of numerology and its connection to Pythagorean thought.
*   **Expand your Knowledge:** Add a fascinating tool to your repertoire for self-discovery and understanding the world around you.

## Diving Deeper: How the Alfabeto Pitagorico Works

The core principle of the Alfabeto Pitagorico is assigning numerical values to letters. The most common system assigns values as follows:

*   **1:** A, J, S
*   **2:** B, K, T
*   **3:** C, L, U
*   **4:** D, M, V
*   **5:** E, N, W
*   **6:** F, O, X
*   **7:** G, P, Y
*   **8:** H, Q, Z
*   **9:** I, R

To calculate the numerological value of a word or name, simply add up the numerical values of each letter. For example, the name "JOHN" would be calculated as:

J (1) + O (6) + H (8) + N (5) = 20

Next, reduce the result to a single digit by adding the digits together:

2 + 0 = 2

Therefore, the numerological value of the name "JOHN" is 2. This single-digit number is then interpreted based on the established meanings associated with each number in numerology.

**Key Concepts within the Alfabeto Pitagorico:**

*   **Name Number:** The numerological value calculated from an individual's full birth name. It reveals core personality traits and life path tendencies.
*   **Expression Number:** Calculated from the letters in your commonly used name. This number reveals your talents and abilities.
*   **Heart's Desire Number:** Derived from the vowels in your name. This reveals what you truly desire and what motivates you.
*   **Personality Number:** Calculated from the consonants in your name. This shows how you present yourself to the world.
*   **Life Path Number:** This is derived from your birthdate. It indicates the major lessons and opportunities you will encounter in life.
