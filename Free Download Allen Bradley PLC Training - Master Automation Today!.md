## What are the different Allen-Bradley PLC Families

Allen-Bradley, now part of Rockwell Automation, offers a variety of PLC families to cater to different application requirements. Each family has its own characteristics in terms of processing power, memory, I/O capacity, and features. Here's a breakdown of some of the most common Allen-Bradley PLC families:

*   **Micro800 Family:** This is the most compact and cost-effective family, ideal for small standalone machines and basic automation tasks. Micro800 PLCs are programmed using Connected Components Workbench (CCW) software.
*   **MicroLogix Family:** An older but still widely used family, the MicroLogix PLCs are suitable for small to medium-sized applications. They are programmed using RSLogix 500 software.
*   **CompactLogix Family:** A versatile family that bridges the gap between the MicroLogix and ControlLogix families. CompactLogix PLCs offer a good balance of performance, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. They are programmed using Studio 5000 Logix Designer software.
*   **ControlLogix Family:** The most powerful and scalable family, designed for large and complex automation systems. ControlLogix PLCs offer high-speed processing, advanced features, and extensive I/O capabilities. They are programmed using Studio 5000 Logix Designer software.
*   **PLC-5 Family:** An older generation PLC that is slowly being phased out but may still be found in legacy systems.

Understanding the differences between these PLC families is crucial for selecting the right PLC for a specific application. The Udemy course linked above aims to provide a solid introduction to these concepts to help you decide what path is best for you.
