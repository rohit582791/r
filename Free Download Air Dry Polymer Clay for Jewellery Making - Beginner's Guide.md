Here are just a few of the reasons why air dry polymer clay is a fantastic choice:

*   **No Baking Required:** Simply let your creations air dry for 24-48 hours, depending on their thickness.
*   **Easy to Work With:** It's soft and pliable, making it easy to mold, shape, and detail.
*   **Versatile:** Can be used to create a wide range of jewellery pieces, from earrings and pendants to bracelets and rings.
