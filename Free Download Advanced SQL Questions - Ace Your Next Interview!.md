## Key Advanced SQL Concepts Explained

Let's delve into some of the **key advanced SQL concepts** you'll learn in this course:

### 1. Window Functions

Window functions are a powerful tool for performing calculations across a set of table rows that are related to the current row. Unlike aggregate functions, which group rows into a single summary row, window functions return a value for each row in the result set. This allows you to perform calculations such as calculating running totals, ranking rows within a partition, and finding the difference between a row and its preceding row.

**Example:** Calculate the running total of sales for each product category.

```sql
SELECT
    category,
    product_name,
    sales,
    SUM(sales) OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY sales) AS running_total
FROM
    sales_table;
```

### 2. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

CTEs are temporary named result sets that you can reference within a single SQL statement. They are incredibly useful for breaking down complex queries into smaller, more manageable parts, improving readability and maintainability. CTEs can also be used recursively, allowing you to traverse hierarchical data structures.

**Example:** Find all employees who report to a specific manager using a recursive CTE.

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE EmployeeHierarchy AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        employee_name,
        manager_id
    FROM
        employees
    WHERE
        manager_id IS NULL -- Start with the top-level manager

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        e.employee_id,
        e.employee_name,
        e.manager_id
    FROM
        employees e
    JOIN
        EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id
)
SELECT
    employee_name
FROM
    EmployeeHierarchy
WHERE
    manager_id = 123; -- The ID of the manager you're interested in
```

### 3. Subqueries and Correlated Subqueries

A subquery is a query nested inside another query. Subqueries can be used in various parts of a SQL statement, such as the `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, and `HAVING` clauses. A correlated subquery is a special type of subquery that depends on the outer query for its values. This means that the subquery is executed once for each row processed by the outer query.

**Example:** Find all customers who have placed orders greater than the average order amount.

```sql
SELECT
    customer_id,
    customer_name
FROM
    customers
WHERE
    customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM orders WHERE order_amount > (SELECT AVG(order_amount) FROM orders));
```

### 4. Performance Tuning

Optimizing SQL queries is crucial for ensuring that your applications run efficiently. There are several techniques you can use to improve query performance, including:

*   **Using Indexes:** Indexes can significantly speed up query execution by allowing the database to quickly locate specific rows.
*   **Rewriting Queries:** Sometimes, simply rewriting a query can improve its performance.
*   **Analyzing Execution Plans:** Execution plans provide insights into how the database is executing your query, allowing you to identify bottlenecks.

### 5. Advanced Joins

Understanding the different types of joins is essential for effectively combining data from multiple tables. Beyond inner joins, you should be familiar with outer joins (left, right, and full), self-joins (joining a table to itself), and cross joins (creating a Cartesian product of two tables).

**Example:** Find all customers and their corresponding orders, even if a customer has not placed any orders (using a left outer join).

```sql
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    o.order_id
FROM
    customers c
LEFT OUTER JOIN
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```
