## Understanding Agile and SAFE

Before diving into the cost, let's clarify what Agile and SAFE are. **Agile** is a project management methodology that emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and responsiveness to change. It’s a philosophy, a set of principles outlined in the Agile Manifesto. **SAFE (Scaled Agile Framework)** is a framework for scaling Agile practices across large enterprises. It helps organizations align multiple agile teams, coordinate their efforts, and deliver value efficiently at scale.

These expenses can add up quickly, making SAFE certification a significant investment. However, what if you could access high-quality training and resources without the hefty price tag?
