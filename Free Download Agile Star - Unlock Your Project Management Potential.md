## What is Agile? A Beginner's Guide

Before diving into the course itself, let's establish a foundational understanding of Agile. Agile is not a single methodology but rather a set of principles and values outlined in the Agile Manifesto. These principles emphasize:

*   **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools:** Prioritizing communication and collaboration within the team.

*   **Responding to change over following a plan:** Adapting to changing requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

*   **Scrum:** An iterative and incremental framework for managing complex projects. Scrum utilizes short cycles called sprints to deliver value to the customer. Roles in Scrum include the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team.
*   **Kanban:** A visual system for managing workflow. Kanban focuses on limiting work in progress (WIP) to improve efficiency and reduce bottlenecks.
*   **Extreme Programming (XP):** A software development methodology that emphasizes code quality, testing, and frequent releases.
