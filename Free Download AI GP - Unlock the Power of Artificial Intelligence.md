## What is AI and Genetic Programming (GP)?

AI, or Artificial Intelligence, encompasses a broad range of techniques that enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and perception.

Genetic Programming (GP) is a specialized type of AI that uses evolutionary algorithms to automatically generate computer programs to solve specific problems. Inspired by biological evolution, GP starts with a population of randomly generated programs and iteratively improves them through processes like selection, crossover, and mutation. This approach allows GP to discover novel and effective solutions, especially in complex domains where traditional programming methods might struggle.
